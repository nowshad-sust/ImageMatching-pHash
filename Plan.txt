Plan of this project

user view:
    1. An image should be selected using file browser
    2. Click a button to see the match result
developer view:
    1. a filepicker
    2. a button to trigger the matching process
    3. a label to view the result

details:
    dataset:
    1. data means two type - images & hash strings
    2. make a dataset making program
        *file browser
        *add button
            #this will add the image to a directed resource folder
            #this will add the image hash string to the bk-tree
    matching:
    1. generate given image's hash string
    2. now run a search through the bk-tree
    3. get the best match images properties from the dataset

    
    Database structure
        values to store
        1.source image path[saved]
        2.source image value [which taka note]
        3.source image hash string
        4.data id[just serial number]
        [using JSON currently instead]
Work Flow:
    1. start the application
    2. load all the hash strings to the bk-tree
        when the application starts
    3. now taka the user input and search from the tree
    4. now we got - nearest matched hash string
    5. if the matching satisfies a minimum percentage
        then we run a query from the database to retrieve
        all info of image with that hash string
    6. show the infos
    7. for enriching the database we can store the info of
        the input image as well
